  <p><strong>To My Constant  Happy Birthday, Big Brother</strong></p>

  <p>I don’t know how to explain what it feels like to be protected without being caged.  
  To be watched over not with rules, but with love.  
  But I’ve lived it.  
  Because I have you.</p>

  <p>You’ve always been there quietly, solidly.  
  In every chapter, every turning point, every silent cry I didn’t say out loud.  
  You just knew.  
  And that’s the thing about you. You always know.</p>

  <p>You’ve been my first shield, my first friend,  
  The one I could always call, even when I didn’t know what to say.  
  You never needed me to be perfect.  
  Just present. Just me.</p>

  <p>When life gets blurry, you stay sharp.  
  When I lose my way, you wait with a light.  
  And even when I push, you stay close.  
  Like gravity unseen but always holding me together.</p>

  <p>I remember when I used to say, "Mummy will kick me out one day,"  
  and ask you if you'll follow me.  
  Then we’d meet a rich old man who turns out to be our real grandpa  
  and gives us plenty money.  
  It was silly. But somehow, it made everything feel okay.  
  Because you made me feel like I’d never be alone even in my worst-case scenarios.  
  Thank you for being my dad, even when you didn't have one.
  for showing me what a man look like even if you didn't have the best example</p>

  <p>I’ve seen strength in many forms,  
  But yours is my favorite gentle, patient, unshakable.</p>

  <p>I could skip a heartbeat, and I would survive.  
  I could crash, fall, burn, and still find my way back.  
  But a world without you? That’s a kind of emptiness I don’t ever want to feel.</p>

  <p>So today, on your birthday, I don’t just celebrate your birth.  
  I celebrate the day the universe decided I wasn’t meant to walk this life alone.  
  Thank you for being my anchor, my mirror, my safe place.  
  May this new year give you as much joy as you’ve given me.  
  And then a little more.</p>

  <p>Happy birthday, big bro.  
  I love you deeper than I’ll ever know how to say.  
  And I’m better and stronger because you exist.</p>
